Native Unicode icons to replace FontAwesome functionality

Version: `1.0.0-beta` (not production ready)

# How to install

Reference the stylesheet in your code:

`<link href="ua.css" rel="stylesheet">`

# Usage

1. Use the Unicode entity inside a `.ua-icon` element:
`<span class="ua-icon">&amp;#128197;</span>`

2. Use the icon class corresponding to your desired icon:
`<span class="ua-icon ua-times"></span>`

Note: Using this method makes sure your icons are mobile compatible, but they might not exist in the library.
